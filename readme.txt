This plugin replaces [wikipedia]topic[/wikipedia] with a wikipedia search link for that term.

== Description ==
The basic idea here is that you can easily link to the wikipedia entry for a given topic by putting the [wikipedia]topic[/wikipedia] tag into your post. The tag is replaced by a link that executes the wikipedia search form for that topic.

The plan is to augment this with a mouseover popup containing an excerpt from the wikipedia page.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `wp-wikipedia-excerpt.php` to the `\wp-content\plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
